init container:
---------------

A Pod can have multiple containers running apps within it, but it can also have one or more init containers, which are run before the app containers are started.

init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:

Init containers always run to completion.
Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.

If a Pod's init container fails, the kubelet repeatedly restarts that init container until it succeeds. However, if the Pod has a restartPolicy of Never, and an init container fails during startup of that Pod, Kubernetes treats the overall Pod as failed.
