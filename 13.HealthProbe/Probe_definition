Startup Probe:
--------------

Just as the name implies, this probe checks if an application within a container has successfully started. If the startup probe fails, Kubernetes assumes that your application is still starting and waits for a while. If the startup probe passes, then any configured liveness and readiness probes will come into effect.


readiness probe:
----------------

The readiness probe is a functionality provided by Kubernetes to determine if a pod is ready to accept requests or, in other words, ready to serve traffic. When a pod is not ready, it is temporarily removed from the service load balancers to prevent it from receiving traffic. This feature is particularly useful for applications that have a significant initialization time or for applications that dynamically manage their readiness based on internal factors.

liveness probe:
---------------

If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will automatically restart the container. This feature is particularly beneficial for applications such as web servers, microservices, messaging, and database systems, where a simple restart can rectify many issues that may otherwise cause the application to crash.
